**Concept and Description**

  Building on my dog for my midterm, I created a virtual dog that you can interact with. It senses when there is a person and barks, wags its tail faster and starts panting when you pet it and does tricks. It can threten (play growling noise), beg (play whining noise) and play dead (stop the automatic barking). The user can interact with hovering the mouse on the commands on my laptop. The dog is made completely out of cardboard, tape and glue gun with cotton balls used for its fur.
