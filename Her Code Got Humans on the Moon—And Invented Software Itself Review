This was an interesting read and I love the fact that it was a woman who made all of this happen! What interested me were the
opinions at the time, the fact that she was percieved as weird because she wasn't a typical stay at home mom. She pursued what
intersted her without abandoning her child (she would bring her daughter with her to work). Another thing that stood out to me
was that she saw a possible error before it happended and attempted to prevent the error from occuring but the higher-ups were
not willing to accept that their trained astronauts were capable of errors. They disregarded one of the fundemental aspects of
interactive projects, the interactee. They disregarded human error and paid the price for it. I think that it's important to
remember that with projects, what can go wrong probably will go wrong.
