  The reading "Design Meets Disability" by Graham Pullin, explores an aspect of design that affects me personally yet I 
hadn't even thought about. What was made evident to me was the importance of labelling. There is a huge difference between
eyeglasses and eyewear, and in the same way there is huge difference in hearing aid and hear wear. I hadn't even really
considered my impared vision as a disability but I realize now that that may have just been the effect of viewing glasses as
both a fashion choice and a necessity. When I wonder why eyeglasses are percieved as more fashionable now, even to the point 
where people who don't actually need eyeglasses use them, is because visual impairement is so common. When comparing that to
a missing limb, for example, I'm sure the number of eyeglass-users is much higher than people who require prosthetic limbs.
That thought aside, another point that stood out to me was the idea that mediocrity cannot be an option. Either the aid has to
so discrete that it is almost invisible or it was to be extremely fashionable in order to prevent stigmatizing those with
disabilities. All in all, this reading was extremely interesting and provided a fresh perspective on design.
